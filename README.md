	This is an implementation of a genetic algorithm. Its behaviours is based
in the params passed to the solver, fot this reason it is higly customizable.
Examples of the usage are present in the test_[float|binary].c which are simple
test of the function offered. More over the genetic.c file contains some simple
and generic implementations such as two crossovers, two parent selection strategies,
two mutation algorithms, .....

The header genetic.h tells how to use the functions.

When the compiling is done with the definition of VERBOSE, lot of debug info
are displayed, anyway, the output slows down the alogorithm, so, use it only if 
needed.
